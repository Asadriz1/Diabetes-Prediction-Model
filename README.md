# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict diabetes based on patient data. It's developed in Python and utilizes several libraries including pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

## Project Overview

The diabetes prediction model is built using a dataset that includes various medical attributes and an outcome indicating the presence of diabetes. The project demonstrates data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Features

- Data exploration and visualization to understand the dataset.
- Data preprocessing including scaling and splitting into training and test sets.
- Training a Support Vector Machine model to predict diabetes.
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy score.
- Making predictions with the trained model.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you'll need the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asadriz1/diabetes-prediction.git
